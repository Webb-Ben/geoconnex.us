## Backups

This directory provides backup xml files that can be used to restore the geoconnex PID server database using "import" command of the PIDsvc API described in the [IoW-PIDsvc repository](https://github.com/internetofwater/IoW-PIDsvc). Beginning July 2020, backup files are split up ito xml files containing 500 or fewer mappings to reduce backup and restore timeout errors.
